I start as a PhD. candidate since 2020 under the supervision of Prof Ng See-Kiong, National University of Singapore.
My research interests lie in knowledge-grounded dialogue systems, healthcare conversational systems, LLM-based multi-agent systems, and Multimodal LLMs. I am also very interested in AI for social science and plan to explore more in the future.
